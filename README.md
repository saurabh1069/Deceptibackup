To create a structured plan for the project you‚Äôve mentioned, I'll break it down into modules based on the key components (App.py, Web UI, Monitoring & Logging). Here‚Äôs a comprehensive plan:

---

### 1) **App.py (Server-Side)**

**Objective**: Implement the server-side functionality that handles decoy services, client-side attack simulation, and fake file system interactions.

#### a) **Server Decoy Modules**

These modules simulate decoy services to detect malicious activities:

* **HTTP Decoy**:

  * Implement an HTTP server that looks like a vulnerable service.
  * Can simulate a server with fake pages or allow interaction with ‚Äúfake‚Äù data.
  * Include logging for incoming requests and analyze patterns (potential attacks).

* **SMTP Decoy**:

  * Implement an SMTP server that mimics an email service.
  * Accept and respond to emails to simulate email exchanges with a potential attacker.
  * Can be used to detect phishing or spam attempts by analyzing received messages.

#### b) **Client Attack Simulation**

* **Email Attack**:

  * Simulate phishing attacks using fake email interactions.
  * A system to send fake or malicious-looking emails to a target system or service (this can be logged and analyzed for patterns).
  * You can generate fake email accounts and send alerts when potential attacks are detected.
  * Integrate AI to flag suspicious emails based on content patterns or metadata.

#### c) **File System (Fake Files)**

* **Fake Document Generation**:

  * Create fake document files such as .txt, .pdf, and .docx that seem legitimate but contain hidden tracking or detection code.
  * Use Python‚Äôs libraries (like `os`, `shutil`, or third-party tools) to generate these fake files dynamically.
  * Integrate with server-side logging to track access to these files.

---

### 2) **Web UI (Frontend)**

**Objective**: Build a front-end dashboard to interact with the server decoys, monitor attacks, and display alerts.

#### 1) **Dashboard UI**

* **Real-Time Alerts**:

  * Display alerts when any of the decoy systems (HTTP, SMTP, etc.) detect potential attacks.
  * Alerts should be dynamic and show real-time information such as attack type, target, and severity.

* **AI Analysis of Attacks**:

  * Integrate AI/ML models that analyze incoming attack patterns (email attacks, HTTP requests, etc.) to predict future attacks or behavior.
  * Display the analysis results on the dashboard (e.g., trend graphs, heat maps).

* **Data Visualization**:

  * Visualize attack data in graphs (like bar charts, line graphs) for quick analysis.
  * This helps in understanding the volume and type of attacks over time.

#### 2) **Login Page**

* **User Authentication**:

  * Allow the admin to securely log in to the dashboard.
  * Implement role-based access (Admin, Analyst) where each role has different permissions.

* **Alerting System**:

  * Include a notification or pop-up system to notify admins of detected attacks when they log in.

---

### 3) **Monitoring & Logging**

**Objective**: Implement a real-time monitoring system and logging for tracking activities across the system.

#### 1) **Real-Time Monitoring**

* **Python Real-Time Monitoring**:

  * Use Python libraries like `psutil` for system performance monitoring.
  * Integrate the monitoring system to check for suspicious activities, such as:

    * High network traffic.
    * Unusual system resource usage.
    * Unauthorized access attempts.
  * Store real-time logs into a central logging system for further analysis.

* **Integration with Web UI**:

  * Display monitoring information in real-time on the dashboard. Use WebSocket or AJAX to fetch updates from the server.
  * Show CPU, memory usage, disk space, and network usage on the dashboard in real-time.

#### 2) **Logging System**

* **Detailed Logs**:

  * Implement logging using Python‚Äôs built-in `logging` library.
  * Capture logs for each decoy interaction, email attack, and fake file access.
  * Store logs in structured formats (JSON, CSV) and allow the dashboard to display them for easy analysis.
  * Include timestamps, IP addresses, user-agents, and other relevant metadata to track activities.

* **Error Handling and Alerts**:

  * Implement error handling and send alerts if any unexpected behavior is detected.
  * Create a system to generate reports and notifications based on critical log entries.

---

### 4) **Future Steps**

* **AI Integration**:

  * Start by training a basic AI model using historical attack data.
  * Gradually enhance the model to predict future attacks and add proactive defenses.

* **Security Measures**:

  * Ensure that all communication (like fake email communication) is secured and protected.
  * Regularly update and patch decoy services to stay ahead of common attack vectors.

---

### Conclusion:

This modular plan will help organize your system effectively by breaking it down into decoys, client-side attack simulations, file systems, UI components, and monitoring/logging features. Once you implement these core components, you can focus on integrating AI for attack prediction and proactive measures.

Step 2: Set Up the Flask HTTP Server (Fake Login Page)
Install Python:

Download and install Python from python.org.

Ensure you check the box to add Python to your system PATH during installation.

Install Required Libraries:

Open Command Prompt and navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
cd path\to\DeceptiCoders
Install the necessary Python libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask Server:

In the same directory, run the Flask application:

bash
Copy
python app.py
The server should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

üìß Step 3: Set Up the Fake SMTP Server
Install Python's secure-smtpd Library:

In Command Prompt, install the library:

bash
Copy
pip install secure-smtpd
Run the SMTP Server:

Navigate to the decoys/server_decoys directory:

bash
Copy
cd decoys\server_decoys
Run the SMTP server script:

bash
Copy
python fake_smtp_server.py
The server should now be running on localhost:1025.

üìÅ Step 4: Serve Fake Files (PDFs and DOCX)
Navigate to the Fake Files Directory:

Go to the decoys/fake_files directory:

bash
Copy
cd decoys\fake_files
Run a Simple HTTP Server:

Start a simple HTTP server to serve the fake files:

bash
Copy
python -m http.server 8000
The files should now be accessible at http://localhost:8000.

üìä Step 5: Set Up the Web UI Dashboard
Navigate to the Web Directory:

Go to the web directory:

bash
Copy
cd web
Run the Dashboard Server:

Start the dashboard server:

bash
Copy
python app.py
The dashboard should now be accessible at http://localhost:5001.

üß† Step 6: AI-Based Attack Detection
Navigate to the AI Integration Directory:

Go to the ai_integration directory:

bash
Copy
cd ai_integration
Run the Real-Time Detection Script:

Start the AI-based attack detection:

bash
Copy
python real_time_detection.py
The script will monitor for suspicious activities and log potential attacks.

üîî Step 7: Monitoring and Alerting
Navigate to the Utils Directory:

Go to the utils directory:

bash
Copy
cd utils
Run the Logger and Notifier:

Start the logging and notification services:

bash
Copy
python logger.py
python notifier.py
These services will monitor the decoy servers and send alerts to the dashboard.

üß™ Step 8: Simulate Attacks
To demonstrate the system's capabilities:

Simulate a Phishing Email:

Use a tool like Telnet or Netcat to send a fake email to the SMTP server:

bash
Copy
telnet localhost 1025
EHLO attacker.com
MAIL FROM: attacker@fake.com
RCPT TO: victim@target.com
DATA
Subject: Urgent!
Open the attached invoice.
.
Attempt a Brute Force Login:

Use a tool like Hydra to attempt a brute-force attack on the Flask login page:

bash
Copy
hydra -l admin -P /path/to/wordlist.txt http://localhost:5000/login
Download Fake Files:

Use curl or a browser to download the fake files:

bash
Copy
curl http://localhost:8000/FakeInvoice.pdf -o FakeInvoice.pdf
üìà Step 9: Monitor the Dashboard
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5001.

You should see the dashboard displaying real-time alerts and logs of the simulated attacks.
